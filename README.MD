# PUZZLES
### The Descent
- Loops and sorting (simple)
- Solving this puzzle makes you understand the concept of loops and the ways of retrieving the maximum value from a list of integers.
  This puzzle can also be a playground to experiment the concept of lambdas in different programming languages.
  It's also an opportunity to discover functional programming.

### Power of Thor - Episode 1
- Conditions (simple)
- In this puzzle, you need to compare different values. You have to correlate character variables and integer variables.
  A straightforward solution uses 8 conditions. There is a way to simplify it and use only 4 conditions.

### There Is No Spoon - Episode 1
- Lists
- In this puzzle, you have to detect special characters from a string. You also have to store input values into a grid to explore it.
  You have to go through all elements from a grid (certainly using a double loop) and from those points, iterate again on some elements of the grid.
  Solving this puzzle make you learn the concept of nested loop.
