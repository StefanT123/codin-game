# WHAT WILL I LEARN?
### Loops, Distances, [Trigonometry](https://www.codingame.com/learn/trigonometry)
This puzzle makes you split a string into substrings, replace a character of a string and convert it into floats. You also have to convert degrees into radians and use mathematical operations like square root or cosinus.

Finally you have to apply multiple computations (addition, multiplication...) on floating numbers.

## STATEMENT
The goal of this exercise is to make you find the closest point to given geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). Your program must print the associated location name.

In this puzzle you will play a lot with conversion (degree to radian, coordinates to distance, string to float).
