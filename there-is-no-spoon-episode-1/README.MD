### [Lists](https://www.codingame.com/learn/lists)
In this puzzle, you have to detect special characters from a string. You also have to store input values into a grid to explore it. You have to go through all elements from a grid (certainly using a double loop) and from those points, iterate again on some elements of the grid. Solving this puzzle make you learn the concept of nested loop.

## STATEMENT
The goal is to find, when they exist, the horizontal and vertical neighbors nodes from a two dimensional array. The difficulty is in the number of nested loops that this puzzle can make you write. Do not get lost!
